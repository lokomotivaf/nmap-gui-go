# Nmap Wrapper App

This app is a simple Nmap wrapper. It allows you to run Nmap commands and see the output in real-time.

## App Overview

This app has 3 tabs: Docs, Scan, and Reports.

- **Docs**: This page contains documentation about this app, a link to the Nmap documentation itself, and some basic info about this app.
- **Scan**: This is where you can run Nmap commands.
- **Reports**: This page is for viewing exported reports from Nmap.

## Getting Started

### About the App

This app is built with Go, Wails, React, React Query, and Radix UI with some really simple styles. It allows you to run Nmap commands and see the output in real-time.

### Why I Built It

I built this app because I kept forgetting all the options for Nmap and wanted to have a simple way to run Nmap commands and view the reports. It has a built-in table with options for working with Nmap, with clickable options for simple command creation.

### Functionality

As it only runs on your machine, I kept the functionality to run any commands, but it is mostly just for Nmap.
